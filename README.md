# GSoC Bionode 2016

## Workflow engine

Take a *streaming data pipeline*, composed of Bionode modules and other
data analysis streaming modules, and integrate with

- SGE
- local machine
- Docker
- Binder

Tasks should be distributed across cluster queueing systems (like SGE) and the
local machine.
